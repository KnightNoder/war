1. India Hosting 2032 olympics 
	
	**Intro**
	- Ancient olympic games held in olympia, greece from 8th century B.C to 4th century A.D
	- IOC(Internationla olympic association formed in 1894) and first olympics held in 1896 in athens,greece.
	
	**Issue**
	- India expressed interest in hosting 2032 olympic games, 2030 asian games and 2026 youth olympic games.
	- 2024 Olympics - Paris and 2028 Olympics - Los Angeles
	- Since single city venue is daunting, IOC introduced new norm of multi-city hosting
	
	**Indian perspective**
	- IOA must consider following points if it wished to host 
	- Prove its mettle in 2020 olympics
	- Host multisport events to prove a point
	- Design a long-term investment plan so that private sector is attracted
	- Identify host cities and develop them
	- Make most of the situation tackling issues such a sanitation, waste management, public health etc.. 

	- Above would be win-win for both the parties
